Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The produced app is an inventory tracking software that uses a user ID and password to authenticate an end user and make sure that only approved updates are made.
The program's purpose is to add, remove, increase, and reduce items that are added to a database once a user has logged in.
A radio button in the app's settings menu can be used to notify the user if the supply falls low.  The inventory is set up in a grid format.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

Four screens make up the application: a login screen, an inventory gride view display, settings and notifications, and an add items flow. 
The application's screens use a range of greens and blues to stay within theme and keep the user in mind while designing the user interface.
Each screen flows to the next without being unclear or deceptive.  For the first of its kind that I had created, 
this application functioned effectively since I made care to adhere to the Android Core Application Quality Doc.


How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

I had high hopes when I first started coding this program and experimented with adding too many features. I had more features and a less active application, 
thus this slowed down the process and eventually led to the program being abandoned. Progressing from this,
I began with a functional program before adding features like a menu or notification system. I am aware that in the future,
I will have to begin development with a functional app before incorporating features.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I experimented with many Android IDK simulated devices with varying screen sizes, including various pixel devices and tables,
to make sure my code was functional and operating. This is significant because, although the developer may create an application with a certain device in mind, 
the final user may utilize the application across multiple devices.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

I had trouble at first organizing everything.  At first, I wasn't sure how to connect the radio button, and even though I had the notification screen configured,
I couldn't make it work with the menu.  After completing a few internet guides, I built the switch.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

Making the log-in authentication screen was enjoyable.  I have most loved working with SQL and its various variants, including mySQL and noSQL.
I am looking forward to integrating databases with other computer languages.
